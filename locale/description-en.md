# Vanilla Fixed Castles
The Vanilla Fixed Castles, formerly known as "Evrey-Fixed" was updated by Xander10alpha to be more compatible with plugins that modify the AIs behaviour.
It features all of the original castles, with slightly updated buildorder, more housing and adjusted storage capacity for wares, weapons and food, to fit all necessary goods for the Vanilla AIs.
This replaces all the AI castles of the Vanilla AIs in their respective order.
